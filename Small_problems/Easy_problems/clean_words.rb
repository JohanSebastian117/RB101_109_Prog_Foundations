# Given a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) 
# and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, 
# write a method that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces.
# If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, 
# you should only have one space in the result 
# (the result should never have consecutive spaces).

- We must run the STRING through a block to find the cases of non-alphabetic characthers
